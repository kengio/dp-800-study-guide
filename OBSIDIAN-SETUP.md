# Obsidian Setup Guide

To ensure the best experience when working with this study guide in Obsidian, we recommend the following configuration and plugins.

## Core Configuration

The `.obsidian/app.json` has been pre-configured with:

- **Strict Line Numbers**: Enabled for easier code referencing.
- **Tab Size**: Set to 4 spaces, standard for T-SQL and database code.
- **Use Spaces**: Hard tabs are disabled to ensure consistent rendering across GitHub and different editors.
- **Inline Title**: Disabled to remove redundant filename display at the top of notes.

## Recommended Plugins

Since Obsidian plugins must be installed manually (or via sync), here are the recommended community plugins to install:

### 1. Obsidian Git

*Essential for version control.*

- **Why**: Allows you to back up your notes to this GitHub repository directly from Obsidian.
- **Setup**:
  - Install **Obsidian Git**.
  - Configure the backup interval (e.g., every 15 minutes) or use Command Palette to commit manually.

### 2. Linter

*Essential for consistency.*

- **Why**: Automatically formats Markdown to adhere to strict standards (e.g., proper spacing between headers, consistent bullet points). This ensures that what you see in Obsidian looks exactly the same on GitHub.
- **Setup**:
  - Install **Linter**.
  - Enable "Lint on save".
  - In settings, enable "Insert newline around block elements" and "Properly formatted headers".

### 3. Advanced Tables

*Quality of Life.*

- **Why**: Markdown tables are notoriously difficult to edit by hand. This plugin auto-formats them as you type.

### 4. Better CodeBlock

*Essential for studying code.*

- **Why**: Adds line numbers, title bars, and copy buttons to code blocks.
- **Search for**: "Better CodeBlock" or "Codeblock Customizer" in Community Plugins.

### 5. Paste URL into selection

*Quality of Life.*

- **Why**: Allows you to highlight text and paste a URL to automatically create a `[text](url)` link.

### 6. Copilot

*AI chat inside Obsidian.*

- **Why**: Chat with AI models (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, local Ollama) directly inside Obsidian. The **Vault QA** mode indexes your entire vault so the AI answers questions using your actual notes as context — ideal for active recall, summarising topics, and generating practice questions from your study material.
- **Search for**: "Copilot" by logancyang in Community Plugins.

#### Setup Steps

1. Install **Copilot** and enable it.
2. Open **Settings → Copilot → Model Providers** and add an API key:
   - **Anthropic** (Claude) — recommended; best for long-context study sessions.
   - **OpenAI** (GPT-4o) — widely supported alternative.
   - **Ollama** — free, runs locally; good for offline study (no API key needed).
3. Set your **Default Chat Model** (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5` or `gpt-4o`).
4. Open the chat panel: `Cmd + P` → **Copilot: Open Copilot Chat**.

#### Vault QA (Index Your Notes)

Vault QA mode lets the AI retrieve relevant notes automatically so answers are grounded in your study material.

1. In **Settings → Copilot → Copilot Plus**, enable **Index vault on startup**.
2. Choose an embedding model (`text-embedding-3-small` for OpenAI, or a local Ollama model).
3. Click **Rebuild Index** after adding new notes.
4. In the chat panel, switch the mode toggle from **Chat** to **Vault QA**.

#### Useful Study Prompts

```text
Summarise the key concepts from my notes on vector search.
Generate 5 practice questions from my notes on Row-Level Security.
What are the differences between ANN and ENN vector search based on my notes?
Quiz me on Always Encrypted.
Explain RAG as if I am preparing for the DP-800 exam.
```

#### Tips

- Use `@filename` in the chat to pin a specific note into context.
- Click the **paperclip icon** to attach the currently open note to the conversation.
- Notes are only sent to the AI when you explicitly include them — nothing is uploaded automatically.

## Installation Instructions

1. Open Obsidian Settings (`Cmd + ,`).
2. Go to **Community Plugins**.
3. Turn off **Restricted mode** (enable community plugins).
4. Click **Browse** and search for the plugin names listed above.
5. Click **Install** and then **Enable**.
